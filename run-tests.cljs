  "The portable suites in this repository, run under nbb.

   All six source files here are `.cljc`, which claims ClojureScript. Until
   2026-08-25 every test was `.clj` and there was no ClojureScript runner, so
   nothing had ever executed that claim -- root ADR-2608730000. The first
   portable test written found the PVQ codebook ceiling coming out as 256
   instead of 2^40 here, and CELT allocating zero pulses to every band.

   The `.clj` suites are not listed and are not forgotten: converting them is
   separate work, and until it is done this file covers less than
   `clojure -M:test` does. The JVM suite remains the primary gate; this is an
   addition to it.

   Anything added to `test/` as `.cljc` belongs in BOTH lists below; being
   required is not being run.
